# Linear-Regression
- Linear Regression tends to establish a relationship between a dependent variable(Y) and one or more independent variable(X) by finding the best fit of the straight line.
- The equation for the Linear model is Y = mX+c, where m is the slope and c is the intercept.

# Where we can apply linear regression ?
- Linear regression only for regression problem statement where we have continuous output.

# What are the assumptions associated with a linear regression ?
- The relationship between X and Y must be linear.
- Yes to Homoscedasticity, No to Hetroscedasticity.
- No Multicollinearity.
- No Auto Regression.
- Zero residual mean.
